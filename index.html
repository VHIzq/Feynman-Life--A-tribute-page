      <h3>Physics, bongoes and strippers</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Philips Richard Feynman was born on May at 1918. His father was a suit military maker and a jew mid class famil.</li>
          <li>Into a very early age, Feynman was learning advanced mathematics and his father used to teaching him the interesting question how to do- art.</li>
          <li>In 1939, Feynman graduated from Massachusetts Institute Technology (MIT) with a thesis about how to calcute molecular forces. Arlene Greenbaum was his girlfriend, but she quickly get sick.</li>
          <li>In 1942 he got a science doctorate where use a peculiar approach to Principle of Least Action ith Archival Wheeler.</li>
          <li>At the beginning of II World War he enrolled to serve as a staff member of the U.S Atomic Bomb Service at Los Alamos, New Mexico.</li>
          <li>As the youngest member of the team, he was considered a leader with Hans Bethe and created the formular to calculate the energy yeld by a nuclear explosive and took charge from computing effort and developed a hybrid human-computer machine.His wife, Arlene, died of tuberculosis while the war was ongoing. </li>
          <li>The Trinity bomb test at 1945 was the first nuclear test explossion and Feynman was there.</li>
          <li>At the end of II World War became a professor from Cornell  University  and returned to study the quantum interactions between electrons and fundamental forces.</li>
          <li>In 1950, became a professor of theorical physics at the California Institute of Technology</li>
          <li>At Caltech he had a epiphany watching a plate witihin other plate and asking the spin relation between them.</li>
          <li>Feynman developed the earlier quanthum electrodynamics calculation between a photon, electrons and positrons.</li>
          <li>By 1948 and further, developed a way to draw the particle interactions, called "Feynman's diagrams".</li>
          <li>In 1950 built a better theory to explain the superfluidity phenomena. At  Caltech loved to visit Stopples Bar and drink 7-up soda.</li>
          <li>In 1958, with Murray Gell-Mann devised a theory to explain the weak forces that participating in decay nuclear.</li>
          <li>Still 1968, in Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLA) were running experiments on scattering of high-energy electrons by protons. </li>
          <li>At SLA invented a theory named "Partons", particle inside nucleus atoms  to help to develop the modern "quark" theory or  quanthum cromodynamics.</li>
          <li>When he got his sabatical year, traveled to Brazil and Japan to learnign to play bongoes, painting woman nudes. Was a member from a Samba team and played into a brazilian party.</li>
          <li>He had a bold and colorful personality with an unconventional mind and a master  calculator to impress cientists in parties and was a  great story teller.</li>
          <li>In 1961, he reorganized and teaching to freshmans the introductory lectures of physics.</li>
          <li>Once re-made the first year lectures, published a seminal and classic textbook named "The Feynman Lectures of Physics" and published other interesting hand books about religion, what menas do science and the beauty of nature.</li>
          <li>Despite be sicking with cancer, do the last fight to understanding and discover the  Challenger space shuttle  explosion and avoid the NASA witness with a dramatic TV demostration by dunking a rubber seal in a glass of ice water
            to show how a predictable failure of the booster rocket's rubber seal might have been frozen in a very cold morning when Challenger was launched.  </li>
          <li>Feynam died in 1968 by cancer, probably to haved exposed to atomic bomb radiation.</li>
          <li>He was married three times and had two childs. A boy named "Carl" and an adopted daughter named "Michel".</li>
          <li>When died, the Caltech's students grab a big poster that said "We love you dick"</li>
          <li>Murray Gell-Mann who was his  most intelectual competitor  teach  to Feynman string theory.</li>
          <li>Nowdays, Richard Feynman is remembered as a great intuitive physicist, a curius mind, a show man to lecturing, a master to paint and drawing and a human that show us the Nature is very interesting.</li>
        </ul>
